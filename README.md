# HeatTransfer
The code allows a user to solve the heat transfer problem with any set of coeffcients,
mesh sizes, boundary conditions and material elements. The program uses all functions to solve for each
method outlined above and compares it with the exact solution. The problem can be initialised by using the Solution Initialisation file in MATLAB
